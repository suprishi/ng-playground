# NgPlayground

This project was intended to serve as a reference for various features in Angular. It would contain examples for usages of many RxJS operators, template driven forms, reactive forms, promises, signals and anything useful in an Angular project.

I hope this project is helpful for someone new to Angular, or, if not new then maybe need a refresher.

Feel free to raise PRs and contribute your own examples.

## Run it locally

Just clone and run `npm install` in its root directory, and then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
